# 0.9.0 - 2025-09-30

## Added

- Added the `targets` input to the `AddInjectNoise` pass to specify boxes to add an `InjectNoise` annotation to.
- Added the `inject_noise_targets` input to `generate_boxing_pass_manager()` to trigger this ability in the boxing transpiler. ([#143](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/143))
- Added a warning at import time about the beta status of this project. The warning should only be raised once per version, see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details. ([#132](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/132))

## Changed

- Removed `NoiseInjectionStrategy.NONE` as it is now redundant with one of the supported values for `AddInjectNoise.targets`. ([#143](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/143))

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `Samplex.__str__()` would raise an error for samplexes that require a noise model. ([#124](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/124))
