# 0.6.0 - 2025-09-03

## Added

- Added an `optional` field to `Specification`. ([#94](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/94))

## Changed

- Modified `undress_box` so that if the input box contains no ``Twirl`` annotation, it returns a copy of the box rather than the box itself. ([#98](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/98))

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the `modifier_ref`s of `InjectNoise` annotations were not being added to a samplex. ([#94](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/94))
- Fixed a bug with imports for `numpy` versions older than `2.0.0`. ([#99](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/99))
