Initial population of the library with features, including:
 - transpiler passes to aid in the boxing of circuits with annotations
 - the `samplomatic.Samplex` object and all necessary infrastructure to
   describe certain types of basic Pauli randomization and noise injection
 - certain but not comprehensive support for dynamic circuits
 - the `build()` method for interpretting boxed-up circuits into template/samplex pairs
