Measurement bit-flips included in the output of `Samplex.sample` are now stored per classical register rather than a single array, for example, the former single entry `"measurement_flips"` will now be two entries `"measurement_flips.alpha"` and `"measurement_flips.beta"` if the underlying circuit has two classical registers named `"alpha"` and `"beta"`.
