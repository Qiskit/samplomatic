Changed the default `twirling_strategy` of `samplomatic.transpiler.generate_boxing_pass_manager` from `"active"` to `"active_circit"`. This was done because the latter is a safer default. Typically, when twirling, one wants to eliminate all coherent error on active qubits. The `"active"` strategy is only able to do this under certain assumptions about noise processes.
