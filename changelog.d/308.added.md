Added the local Clifford twirling group. This group twirls a two-qubit entangling Clifford with the subgroup of single-qubit Cliffords that remain local under conjugation. This feature is enabled by using a `Twirl` annotation with `VIRTUAL_TYPE.local_c1` or `"local_c1"` as the group.
To support new groups like the local Clifford twirling group, added the `twirling_group` keyword argument to the `generate_boxing_pass_manager` function with default `"pauli"`.
Added the `C1PastCliffordNode` and supporting lookup tables in the new `tables` module.
Added the `UniformLocalC1` distribution.
