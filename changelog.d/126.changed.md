The `Samplex.inputs()` method no longer requires an argument and now requires a `NoiseSource` to be set on the `Samplex`.
This can be done with the `Sampex.set_noise_source()` method.
The class `NoiseModelRequirement` has been renamed `NoiseRequirement`.
Throughout the library, the terms noise map and noise model have been replaced with the more descriptive Pauli Lindblad map.
