 - Added a new subclass `samplomatic.tensor_interface.PauliLindbladNoiseSpecification` of `samplomatic.tensor_interface.Specification`.
 - Added the concept of `free_dimensions` to `samplomatic.tensor_inteface.Specification`, which comes with assocated methods and attributes. A free dimension is a string name of an integer quantity whose value is not known until values have been bound to the specification in a `samplomatic.tensor_interface.TensorInterface`, and all free dimensions with the same name in the interface need to have a consistent value or an error will be raised during binding.
