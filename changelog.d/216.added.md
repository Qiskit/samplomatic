- Added a new serialization versioning system, the Samplex Serialization Version (SSV), that decouples the
  serialization version from the package version. The current version is stored in `samplomatic.ssv.SSV`.
  See the `samplomatic.serialization` module for details.
- Added a `Serializable` metaclass to record which classes should be serializable.
- Added `DataSerializer`, `TypeSerializer`, and `TypeSerializerMeta` to provide serialization for objects
  inheriting from `Serializable`.
