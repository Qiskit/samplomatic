In order to facilitate broadcasting, `Samplex.sample()` now expects an array of rates and a `qiskit.quantum_info.QubitSparsePauliList` for each noise reference.
Previously, it expected a `qiskit.quantum_info.PauliLindbladMap`.
This change is reflected in `Samplex.inputs()` which now requires a `qiskit.quantum_info.QubitSparsePauliList` for each element of `Samplex.noise_models`.
The returned `TensorInterface` object then contains the bound `QubitSparsePauliList`s, as well as `TensorSpecification`s for the rates, the scale, and the local scales.
