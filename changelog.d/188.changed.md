Negated the convention for what boolean outputs mean when sampling Pauli Lindblad maps with negative
rates. Following this change, the `InjectNoiseNode` samplex node intentionally uses the opposite
convention as :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliLindbladMap.signed_sample` for representing signs as
boolean values. In particular, values written by this node now represent the parity of the number of
non-trivial factors in the sampled error that arise from negative rates. In other words, when using
the boolean written by this node to implement basic PEC, the sign used to correct expectation values
should be `-1**bool_value`.
