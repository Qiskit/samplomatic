Negated the convention for what boolean outputs mean when sampling Pauli Lindblad maps with negative rates. In particular, following this change, ``True`` is used to represent "the sign should be flipped", and this intentionally differs from the convention used by :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliLindbladMap.signed_sample`, which arguably uses the wrong convention.
