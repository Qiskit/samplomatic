Changed the behaviour of the pass manager returned by `samplomatic.transpiler.generate_boxing_pass_manager` under default settings with respect to how it treats barriers. Before, it would discard all barriers before attempting to put entangling gates into boxes. Now, it discards barriers after entangling gates are put into boxes, but before single-qubit gates are moved into adjacent boxes. This means that barriers can effectively be used as hints to choose how to stratify entangling gates without constraining single-qubit gates to end up in their own boxes. This also has better interaction with the Qiskit transpiler in the case that the original circuit is programmed in terms of a different entangling gate than the target.
