Deprecated boolean values for the `remove_barriers` argument of `samplomatic.transpiler.generate_boxing_pass_manager`. Now, the four options are `'immediately'`, `'finally,`, `'after_stratification'`, and `'never'`, where `True` and `False` are equivalent to the first and last string values, respectively. The default value is `'after_stratification'` which is a change in behaviour, but should be a better choice in most cases.
