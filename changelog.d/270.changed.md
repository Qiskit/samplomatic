The `pre_build` function now constructs the template as a `qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` as opposed to a `qiskit.QuantumCircuit`. Methods on `BoxBuilder`, `PassthroughBuilder`, `PreSamplex`, and `TemplateState` that previously had `qiskit.circuit.CircuitInstruction` in their signature now have `qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGOpNode` instead. The signature of the `build` function has not changed, but now calls the `TemplateState.finalize` method to construct the `qiskit.QuantumCircuit`.
