Added the `decomposition` argument to the `samplomatic.transpiler.generate_boxing_pass_manager()` function that causes all `Twirl` and `ChangeBasis` annotations added by the pass manager to have the specified dressing gate decomposition. The current allowed values are `'rzsx'` (default) and `'rzrx'`. The same argument was also added to the `GroupMeasIntoBoxes` pass, and the `GroupGatesIntoBoxes` pass similarly gained an argument `annotations`.
