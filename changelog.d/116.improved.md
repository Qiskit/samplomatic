`Samplex.sample` arguments corresponding to `BasisTransform` and `InjectNoise` annotations are indexed in physical qubit order, in other words, the order of the qubits in the outer-most circuit, restricted to those used by the box.
Previously, they followed the order of `CircuitInstruction.qubits`.
