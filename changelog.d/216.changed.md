- The samplex serialization functions `samplex_to_json` and `samplex_from_json` were moved to the
  `samplomatic.serialization` module.
- Classes that are serializable now inherit from `Serializable` and specify a `TYPE_ID` rather than
  implementing `to_json`/`from_json` methods. A `TypeSerializer` with the same `TYPE_ID` will then
  contain methods to serialize and deserialize the object.
