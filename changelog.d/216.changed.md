- The samplex serialization functions `samplex_to_json` and `samplex_from_json` were moved to the
  `samplomatic.serialization` module.
- Classes that are serializable now inherit from `Serializable` rather than implementing `to_json`/`from_json`
  methods. A `TypeSerializer` with the corresponding type will then contain methods to serialize and deserialize
  the object.
