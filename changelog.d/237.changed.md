Changed the scope of the transpiler passes `GroupGatesIntoBoxes`, `GroupMeasIntoBoxes`, and `AddTerminalRightDressedBoxes`. Formerly, all three of these passes were responsible for discovering single-qubit gates in the input circuit and moving them into newly created boxes. Now, to simplify their implementations and make the pass manager more modular, these three passes no longer have this responsibility, which has instead been delegated to the new pass `AbsorbSingleQubitGates`. In particular, `GroupGatesIntoBoxes` and  `GroupMeasIntoBoxes` are now responsible only for inserting new left-dressed boxes populated only with entangling and measurement instructions. Similarly, `AddTerminalRightDressedBoxes` inserts empty right-dressed boxes boxes. The `generate_boxing_pass_manager` function has been updated to include `AbsorbSingleQubitGates`.
