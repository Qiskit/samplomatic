# 0.12.0 - 2025-11-03

## Added

- Added a new serialization versioning system, the Samplex Serialization Version (SSV), that decouples the
  serialization version from the package version. The current version is stored in `samplomatic.ssv.SSV`.
  See the `samplomatic.serialization` module for details. ([#216](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/216))
- Added a `Serializable` metaclass to record which classes should be serializable. ([#216](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/216))
- Added `DataSerializer`, `TypeSerializer`, and `TypeSerializerMeta` to provide serialization for objects
  inheriting from `Serializable`. ([#216](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/216))

## Changed

- The samplex serialization functions `samplex_to_json` and `samplex_from_json` were moved to the
  `samplomatic.serialization` module. ([#216](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/216))
- Classes that are serializable now inherit from `Serializable` rather than implementing `to_json`/`from_json`
  methods. A `TypeSerializer` with the corresponding type will then contain methods to serialize and deserialize
  the object. ([#216](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/216))
