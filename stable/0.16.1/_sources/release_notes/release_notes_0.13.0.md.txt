# 0.13.0 - 2025-11-06

## Changed

- A samplex built with `build` always returns `parameter_values` as an output. If it does not
  generate parameter values, the `parameter_values` will have shape `("num_randomizations", 0)`.
  Previously, `parameter_values` would not be included in its outputs. ([#225](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/225))

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the slicing indices of `SliceRegisterNodes` were wrong, causing circuits with non-standard ordering to sample incorrectly (particularly with `merge_parallel_pre_propagate_nodes` enabled). ([#229](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/229))
