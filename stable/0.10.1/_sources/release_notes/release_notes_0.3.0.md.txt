# 0.3.0 - 2025-08-22

## Removed

- Removed `samplomatic.samplex.interfaces.SamplexInput`, just use `samplomatic.tensor_interface.TensorInterface` instead. ([#79](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/79))

## Added

- Added the `broadcastable` attribute to `TensorSpecification`, with the behaviour that all broadcastable tensor values given to a `TensorInterface` are allowed to be mutually broadcastable. ([#79](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/79))

## Changed

- Measurement bit-flips included in the output of `Samplex.sample` are now stored per classical register rather than a single array, for example, the former single entry `"measurement_flips"` will now be two entries `"measurement_flips.alpha"` and `"measurement_flips.beta"` if the underlying circuit has two classical registers named `"alpha"` and `"beta"`. ([#78](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/78))
- Renamed and moved `samplomatic.samplex.interfaces.Interface` to `samplomatic.tensor_interface.TensorInterface`. Likewise moved `Specification` and `TensorSpecification` to `samplomatic.tensor_interface`. Changed `Samplex.inputs()` to return a `TensorSpecification`, populated with what used to be the defaults of `SamplexInput`. ([#79](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/79))
