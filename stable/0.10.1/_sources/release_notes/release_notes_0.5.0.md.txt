# 0.5.0 - 2025-08-26

## Added

- Added new boolean option `remove_barriers` to `generate_boxing_pass_manager()` that adds the `RemoveBarriers` pass to the returned pass manager when true. ([#88](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/88))

## Changed

- The pass manager returned by `generate_boxing_pass_manager()` now removes all pre-existing barriers, by default. ([#88](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/88))
