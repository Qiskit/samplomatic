# 0.2.0 - 2025-08-20

## Added

- Added the `Samplex.inputs()` and `Samplex.outputs()` methods to query the required inputs and promised outputs of `Samplex.sample()`. ([#75](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/75))

## Changed

- Renamed the parameter `size` to `num_randomizations` in the `Samplex.sample()` method. ([#69](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/69))
- The `build()` function now calls `Samplex.finalize()` so that it does not need to be called afterwards manually.
  Additionally, the `Samplex.finalize()` method now returns itself for chaining calls. ([#72](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/72))
- The `Samplex.sample()` method now takes a `SamplexInput` as argument rather than keyword arguments.
  This object can be constructed with the new `Samplex.inputs()` method and only includes arguments pertinent to a given instance of `Samplex`. ([#75](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/75))
