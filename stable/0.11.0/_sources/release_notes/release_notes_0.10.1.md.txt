# 0.10.1 - 2025-10-22

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the `build()` process was mishandling an optimization step in the case the base circuit contains multiple `rx` (or `rz`) gates in the same layer with distinct bound numeric values (e.g. `circuit.rx(0.123, 0)`). ([#179](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/179))
