# 0.4.0 - 2025-08-26

## Added

- Added support for measurements after twirled measurements. ([#82](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/82))

## Changed

- Moved `num_randomizations` back to a kwarg of `Samplex.sample()`. This has flip-flopped a couple of times as we optimize workflow. ([#84](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/84))

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug in `TensorInterface.__getitem__` for non-string inputs where it was incorrectly attempting to slice arrays whose shape did not match the full broadcasted shape of the interface. ([#83](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/83))
- Fixed serialization of `Samplex` by including the passthrough parameters field.
  Previously, this would result in inconsistent output parameter values when sampling from the same samplex with the same input arguments. ([#86](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/86))
