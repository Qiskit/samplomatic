# 0.11.0 - 2025-10-28

## Added

- Added the ability to provide inputs to `Samplex.sample()` as arbitrary mappings. ([#186](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/186))

## Changed

- Changed the serialization format of `qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression`s within the samplex serializer. ([#185](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/185))
- Negated the convention for what boolean outputs mean when sampling Pauli Lindblad maps with negative
  rates. Following this change, the `InjectNoiseNode` samplex node intentionally uses the opposite
  convention as :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliLindbladMap.signed_sample` for representing signs as
  boolean values. In particular, values written by this node now represent the parity of the number of
  non-trivial factors in the sampled error that arise from negative rates. In other words, when using
  the boolean written by this node to implement basic PEC, the sign used to correct expectation values
  should be `(-1)**bool_value`. ([#188](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/188))

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug that prevented `qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression`s from being decoded when present in a samplex' expression table. ([#185](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/185))
